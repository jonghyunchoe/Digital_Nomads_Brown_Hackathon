# Digital Nomads
Our team's Hack@Brown 2021 submission Digital Nomads is a project based on enriching children's after school activities through a safe and online experience. The world is available at just the click of a mouse. Team members include myself, Jennifer Wang and Nikki Sohn. 

## Inspiration
With travel restrictions, temporary closures of attractions, and transition to online learning, COVID-19 has altered the lifestyle of millions of families. We were inspired to see what an alternative form of travel could look like. 

## What it does
Digital Nomads is a project based on enriching children's after school activities through a safe and online experience. The world is available at just the click of a mouse, taking you to Google Map's street view of each building. While not physically there, children will have the opportunity to explore and discover world attractions at our interactive background museum.

## How I built it
We used Glitch and js!

## Challenges I ran into
Some of the main challenges we ran into included figuring out how to link the 3D objects and the hyperlink to the Google Map. Originally hoping to make the buildings themselves click to another link, we realized the difficulty of making this work on a 3D landscape. Therefore, we utilized buttons instead. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are proud that we were able to finish this project in 24 hours. For most of us, it was our first hackathon, and so it was a novel opportunity to attend workshops, collaborate with fellow students, and propose a hack that could help other children.
